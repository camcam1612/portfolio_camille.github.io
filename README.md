Personnal portfolio for my internships applications
Welcome on my Github Portfolio !

I have uploaded a fair part of my academic and personnal work of this last two years. Some might be a little simplistic, but they are here as a testimony of my progress.
All the work presented here is mine, except from the London Heartbeat graphic that I made during a UCL class with James Cheshire (I am capable of developping it, but the style belongs to him).

In the "Maps" folder, you will find maps I did while at UCL, and a few from my Master's degree program. The maps were developped with Qgis, ArcGis, and R.

In the Graphics folder, I added a few samples of what I am able to do but most of my skills where shown on my resume.

In the coding folder, you will see samples of my coding skills in Python. I unfortunately do not have any relevant code in the other languages I know.

Thank you for making time to examine my work.
Have a nice day,
Camille
